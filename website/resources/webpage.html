        <h2>Guide on how to setup Boodle</h2>
        <p>
          In this section you will be granted an easy amd guick guide on on how
          to setup Boodle on your Discord server in a few simple steps.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 1 - Log into your Discord account</h3>
        <p>
          The first thing you will have to do is click on the following button,
          where you will have to log into your Discord account:
        </p>
        <input
          type="button"
          value="Log into Discord"
          onclick="location.href ='https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=953227423862890526&permissions=292058032192&scope=bot%20applications.commands'; "
        />
        <h3>Step 2 - Connect Boodle to your Discord server</h3>
        <p>
          After you have logged in you will be presented by a page similar to
          this: <br /><br />
          <img
            id="connectboodle"
            class="guideimg"
            src="./images/Boodle_login_screen.png"
            alt="Connect Boodle to Discord server"
          />
          <br /><br />
          Choose which server you want Boodle on in the dropdown menu at "Add to
          server". Click continue.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 3 - Setup Boodle on your Discord server</h3>
        <p>
          When you have added the bot to the desired discord server, you will
          need to set it up personally, so it can start sending you the Moodle
          information that you desire. To setup Boodle on your Discord server
          you will have to write the command /setup in the chat, and click on
          the link that Boodle sends in the chat.<br />
        </p>
        <h3>Step 4 - Find personal Moodle token</h3>
        <p>
          Now you have to find your personal Moodle token, you need to login to
          Moodle first, and then click on your name in the top right side of the
          webpage.<br /><br />
          Then click preferences in the top down menu and you will be met with a
          lot of different options. <br /><br />
          From here you have to click on the security keys option, which will
          lead you to a site with 3 keys. The key that is needed for the bot is
          the bottom one also called "Moodle mobile web service"<br /><br />
          Copy and paste this into the input field on the website. <br /><br />
          If you dont want to use the bot anymore, you can just click the reset
          bottom on Moodle and the bot will not work until you input the new
          Moodle token.<br /><br />
